# fnPrompt
A custom shortcut tool

## Usage

- Save `fn_primpt.sh` somewhere (`~/bin/` for me)
- Open `GNOME settings` > `Keyboard Shortcuts` > `+`
    - `Name` : `FnFn`
    - `Command` : `~/bin/fn_prompt.sh`
    - `Shortcut` > `Set Shortcut` > hit your `Fn` key
        - Something like "Wake up" or "XF86WakeUp" should appear
- Hit `Fn`, `Fn`, `e`, scroll down to "Commands" and make it your own!

My timeouts are `0.3` and `0.5`, and I cut out a bunch of shortcuts that just
open some google doc or a webpage that I want to peek at for a second.

## Inspiration
I think messing aound with [X-Keys][1] when I was working at RedHat gave me
the idea. I wanted something like that, but frictionless enough that I could
easily experiment - adding and removing shortcuts without too much difficulty.
